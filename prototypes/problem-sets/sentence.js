/* Sentence Prompts*/

/*
Level 1

Code: 
  Write a function called "countLetters" that takes in a letter and counts how many times that letter appears in the sentence. Capitalization should not matter.

Invoke: 
  To print the value your function returns and confirm it is correct, invoke your function within a console.log().
e.g.
  console.log(countLetters('t')) 
    // should print ==> 2

  console.log(countLetters('z'))
    // should print ==> 0

  console.log(countLetters('E'))
    // should print ==> 5

Annotate:
  After you find a solution, write out the steps of that solution.  Break them down as much as possible. 
*/


/*
Level 2

Code: 
  Write a function called "findLetterCounts" that returns an object which lists all the letters (lowercase) and how many times that letter appears.
   
  Note: Keep the spaces and ! in your object. 

Invoke:
  To print the value your function returns and confirm it is correct, invoke your function within a console.log().
e.g.
  console.log(findLetterCounts())
    should print -->   
    {
        p: 1,
        o: 4,
        t: 2,
        a: 3,
        e: 5,
        s: 3,
        ' ': 4,
        r: 1,
        u: 2,
        n: 1,
        b: 2,
        l: 3,
        i: 3,
        v: 1,
        y: 1,
        d: 1,
        c: 1,
        '!': 1
      }

Annotation:
  After you find a solution, write out the steps of that solution.  Break them down as much as possible.

/*
Level 3

Test:
  * Uncomment the module.exports below.
  * Unskip the sentence prompts tests in your prototype-test.js file.
  * Run `npm test` to confirm that all your functions are passing their tests.
  * Refactor as needed until all sentence tests are passing

Annotation:
  If your tests did not immediately pass, take notes on what details you missed while building and checking your solutions. 
  Take notes on the error messages that led you to fixing those details.
